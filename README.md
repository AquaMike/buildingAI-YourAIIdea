# AI could help football clubs to make a Team

Final project for the "Building AI course" around football clubs making a competitive team

## Summary

The goal of this project is to have a refexion on how an AI can build mathematicals information and help to determine which players we need in a football team to have a competitive team.
This AI could, with some idea of team playing and about the manager philisophy to determine the best team to make.


## Background

This AI can help to help players recruitment during mercato for football clubs. The AI can help constantly to help the performance of each players after each game.
I loved football and I saw Moneyball where a manager make a team based on data analysis and I think it could help a lot of football clubs to have some data models and AI to help us in decision.

## How is it used?

We can create a big data database with a lots of carateristics like in Football Manager game. This game already helps recruters to search and have some informations before going to see the player playing a game.
After making the database, we can search with an AI with a little description whiwh player is better for doing a role in a tactic.

## Challenges

This representation will not take care about the comportment and about the mental the player have and need to be followed by specialist psychology for example.

## What next?

I will need assistance to make it grow to create the database with the carateristics needed for a specific tactic. And we need to analyse a lots of games to put the good notationon each players.
It will a big time neede to modelize.
